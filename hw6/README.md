Mini-Project for CP1 at CCA FALL2019.

I have been able to build a web page with HTML/CSS into the p5.js editor.

Here is the mockup of the website

Here is the link to the p5.js

## Additional Documentation

After speaking to the Instructor, the design has changed to just being the P5.JS artwork built in JavaScript.

So the first thing to do is remove the HTML/CSS elements.

Then instead of having the white curtain design.

Just have the full piece to have blue triangles, across the full design.

When the cursor is over a blue triangle just have some kind of color change effect, as well as a sound element.

Also if it's easier, instead of triangles use squares.
